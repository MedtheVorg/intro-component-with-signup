## My process

I started with html planning which elements to use then styled the page with CSS(SASS) and finaly JavaScript

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Pure JavaScript

### What I learned

- I learned that going with the mobile first aproach is ideal as the elemens are by default layed correctly and there is no need to use flex or grid
- this made me realise that setting the html/body height to 100% all the time is not ideal to every situation and mess up the layout sometimes
